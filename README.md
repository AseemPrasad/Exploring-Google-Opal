This is a project made as a part of exploration of google opal. 

Opal is basically a brand new ai tool by Google, which helps one to make mini apps and automation workflows as well..
It is basically an experimental project now built upon gemini models..

We can just describe what we want and opal turns that into a working mini app.

Just plain to english to working prototype and best part is it generates the ui itself and workflows are editable visually..the whole process is no code making it a very valuable tool..
Now, the typical use cases for which opal is used is rapid prototyping to showcase ideas and built simple internal tools for one's own work requirements..

Google opal requires no logic setup and other processes..just a proper prompt in simple English and it connects ai steps automatically..

It also shows us the working behind the scenes, how input is taken, then the processing steps and the output..
We can rearrange the steps and edit prompts as per our wish..
There are built in gemini options which gives support for text generation, summarization and reasoning chains..
No external APIs are required in here..

Opal generates a web based interface automatically with clear simple layouts..

It also supports file uploads but not meant for complex data..

We can also share our app via link and others can use the app instantly..


I have made two basic projects using google opal and one can access both their links and demos in the given file.

Feel free to have a look...
